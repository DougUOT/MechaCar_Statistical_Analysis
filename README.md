# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Learn how to use R and statistics in order to analyze vehicle data

## Overview of Project

In this project we'll learn how to design statistical studies and interpret study results which will allow us to take on more advanced data engineering problems. Also, in this project we will cover the basics of R including reading in the dataset, manipulating the data, performing calculations, and visualizing the data using a variety of 2D plots. Additionally, we'll use R to perform all of our statistical tests and analyses.
