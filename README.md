Written Summary
In your README, create a subheading, ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG, and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The estimate of the ideal vehicle performance effect of vehicle length is 6.267, while the performance of vehicle weight is 0.001245, spoiler angel is 0.06877, ground clearance is 3.546 and AWD is -3.411.

So on-base of the variables results above, we do have vehicle length and ground clearance results with the relationship. 

Related to the estimate results, this means that for every 1% increase in vehicle length, there is a correlated 6% increase in a performance vehicle. Meanwhile, for every 1% increase in ground clearance, there is a 4% increase in a performance vehicle.

Regarding to the t-value, this is the t-statistic for the predictor variable, calculated as (Estimate) / (Std. Error). We do have the vehicle length with 9.563 and ground clearance with 6.551 and both are statistically significant. 

About the Pr(>|t|), This is the p-value that corresponds to the t-statistic. We do have a vehicle length of 2.60e-12 and ground clearance of 5.21e-08. The result is less than 0.05, so It means that the variable is statistically significant.

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

According to the results, the p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%. Thusly, we can express that there is adequate proof to reject our null hypothesis, and that intends that the slope of the linear model analyzed in our project is not zero.

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The r-squared (r2) value is known as the coefficient of determination. It lets us how well the regression model approximates real-world data points. We have a multiple R-Squared of 0.7149, which implies that generally, 71.49% of the variability of our reliant variable is clarified utilizing this linear model. By and large, a higher r-squared shows a superior fit for the model, its means that the linear model result predicts the MechaCar prototypes effectively

Moreover, we do have a p-value of 5.35e-11 or 0.0000000000535. This result is less than some significance level (ex: 0.05), and its means that the predictor variables help foresee the worth of the response variable.

By joining the p-value of our  of our hypothesis test with the r-squared value, the linear regression model turns into a robust statistics tool that both evaluates a connection among variables and gives a significant model to be utilized in any decision-making process

Even removing the formula for the following variables such as vehicle_weight, spoiler angle and AWD, we have a Multiple R-squared of 0.674 and a p-value of 3.637e12. Its means that the linear model result still predicts the MechaCar prototypes  effectively.

## Objective 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

CODE & IMAGE

![](https://github.com/DougUOT/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/Capture15_2_Code.PNG)

* Write an RScript that creates a total_summary dataframe using the summarize() function to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coilâ€™s PSI column.

Follow below a brief detail and interpretation of all summary statistics of the suspension coil: 

** Mean is the sum of all values divided by the total or count of the number of values;
** Median is the middle value of the data set or numbers;
** Variance is how far a set of data values are spread out from their mean;
** Standard deviation is an action that is used to to evaluate how much variety or scattering of a set of data values; 

Mean PSI with 1498.78, Median PSI with 1500, Variance (Var_PSI) with 62.29 and Standard deviation (Std_Dev_PSI) with 7.892627

According to the image below, we do have the PSI metrics for all manufactoring lots

![](https://github.com/DougUOT/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/Capture15_2_1.PNG)

* The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

Follow bellow the PSI metrics for each manufactoring lot:

![](https://github.com/DougUOT/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/Capture15_2_2.PNG)

* The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

According to analysis the design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils related to the manufacturing lots 1 and 2 meet the variance of the suspension coils, and it does not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Manufacturing lot 1 has 0.98 pounds per square inch, and lot 2 has 7.47 pounds per square inch.

However, the manufacturing lot 3 has 170.29 pounds per square inch e thus does exceed 100 pounds per square inch e do not meet the design specification for the MechaCar suspension coils.

As explained before, the variance is how far a set of data values are spread out from their mean. So the manufacturing lot 3, in other words, is an outlier compared to other results and should be reviewed by the responsible at MechaCar company.

Moreover, the standard deviation of lot 3 has a high difference compared to lots 1 and 2. This result supports the analysis that lot three should be verified and does not meet the design specification.

## Objective 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

* An RScript is written for t-test that compares all manufacturing lots against mean PSI of the population 

![](https://github.com/DougUOT/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/Capture15_3_Code.PNG)

* An RScript is written for three t-tests that compare each manufacturing lot against mean PSI of the population
* * There is a summary of the t-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot  

In our project, we will write an RScript using the t.test() function to determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

According to the results, we do have a p-value of 0.06028, which is much larger than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, thus we can express that there is adequate proof to reject our null hypothesis. In addition, we do have a mean of 1498.78, which means that the three lots analyzed are very close to statistically from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch

![](https://github.com/DougUOT/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/Capture15_3_1.PNG)

Next, we will write three more RScripts in our project using the t.test() function and its subset() argument to determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Follow below an brief analysis for each lot.

Manufacturing lot 1:

According to the results, we do have a p-value of 1, and mean of 1500, definitely, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis and also the manufacturing lot 1 is not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Manufacturing lot 2:

According to the results, we do have a p-value of 0.6072, and mean of 1500.02, definitely, we must fail to reject the null hypothesis and also the manufacturing lot 1 is not statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

Manufacturing lot 3:

According to the results, we do have a p-value of 0.04168, and mean of 1496.14. The p-value result of the Manufacturing lot 3 had a different result when we compared to the results of lots 1 and 2, which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%, we must reject the null hypothesis and the two menas are  statistically different.

## Objective 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

We will Using our knowledge of R, design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar vehicles against performance of vehicles from other manufacturers.

* What metric or metrics are you going to test?

** Sales price (Numeric and Continuous variables): Sales price of a new car on the market. Goal is to buy sales price with competitors, whether cheaper or expensive
** City fuel efficiency (Numerical and Continuous variables) How many liters of fuel the car uses in a 1 km in the city or urban traffic. The objective is to verify if the car is economical in the use of fuel in the city vs competitors.
** Highway fuel efficiency (Numeric and Continuous variables) How many liters of fuel does the car use in 1 km on the road. The objective is to verify if the car is economical in the use of fuel on the road vs competitors.
** Maintenance cost (Numeric and Continuous variables) What is the average maintenance cost per year. The objective is to compare the average maintenance cost (oil change, etc) per year vs competitors.
** Odometer (Numeric and Continuous variables) How many km driven after the car was first purchased. The objective is to check if the car has many km driven or how many km this used car has vs competitors.
**Resale price (Numeric and Continuous variables) what is the resale price considering the car is used. The objective is to verify what the resale price would be after being used, if the car is still valued or if the car has depreciated against the prices of used cars of the competition.

* What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

The null and alternate hypotheses are used to explain one of two outcomes from our proposed question, and both are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. In other words, no matter what, one of these statements must be used to explain our analysis results.

Notice that our null hypothesis the situation that our outcomes can be clarified by irregular possibility with no external impact. Conversely, our substitute theory addresses whatever other situation that our outcomes could yield.
When we laid out our null and alternate hypothesis, we would then have to distinguish a statistical analysis to survey in the event that our invalid theory is valid.

** Ho | Null Hypothesis: When comparing MerchCar's variables with competitors, do customers have a perceived price value?
** Ha | Alternative Hypothsis: When comparing MerchCar's variables to competitors, do customers NOT have a perceived price value? 


* What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

In spite of the fact that information assortment and examination are significant, the foundation of the logical technique is hypothesis testing. Hypotheses are used by the logical technique to assist with limiting the extent of exploration and testing as well as give a reasonable result of our outcomes. Without creating a bunch of hypothesis, it turns out to be dramatically more hard to evaluate results and give quantifiable results to our analyses. As data analysts, we must match a bunch of hypotheses to an appropriate statistical test to guarantee that outcomes are deciphered accurately.

The p-value, or probability value, lets us know the probability that we would see comparable outcomes assuming we tried our information once more, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Subsequently, we utilize the p-value to give quantitative proof regarding which of our p-value are valid.

As well as deciding an importance level in view of the significance of our discoveries, we should guarantee our hypotheses and statistical tests are either one-tailed or two-tailed. The tails of our hypotheses or statistical tests are alluding to the distribution of measurements or observations used in the analysis.

Assuming our hypotheses and statistical test are both two-tailed, we can use the statistical test p-value as is. On the other hand if our hypotheses are one-tailed, yet ourstatistical test is two-tailed, we can divide the statistical test p-value by 2

If our determined p-value is more modest than our importance level, we would express that there is sufficient statistical evidence that our null hypothesis is not true, and in this manner we would reject our null hypothesis. Then again, if our determined p-value is bigger than our importance level, we would express thatwe do not have sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis, and along these lines we fail to reject our null hypothesis.

* What data is needed to run the statistical test?

I recommend doing a statistical analysis, using t-test in order to obtain test results of the hypothesis. Another analysis I recommend is the correlation analysis using pairs of variables, such as Sale Price vs Resale Price, City vs Highway Fuel Efficiency, Sale Price vs Maintenance Cost, Sale Price vs Resale Price, and Odometer vs. resale to check if there is any positive or negative correlation between the variables. Finally, I would recommend using the correlation matrix and linear regression (using the lm and summary function on R) with all variables. 

In order to standardize the metrics of each value in the dataset, I recommend using prices in dollars ($), fuel in liters or gallons, and for fuel efficiency (city or highway) I suggest that it be analyzed considering how much fuel is in liters or gallons, that a vehicle uses traveling 1 km.
